An exercise sample taken from Udemy's "Ethereum and Solidity, the complete developers guide" course, created by Stephen Grider.

## What we can learn from this sample

In this sample we can learn how to create & also testing an Ethereum smart contract project. The details are listed at below:

* Define structure of Ethereum Solidity project.

* Setup required project's dependencies.

* Writing the smartcontract by using Solidity language.

* Compile the contract using `solc` library and exporting the compiled contract's bytecode and ABI. 

* Create system test against the compiled contract by using Mocha test.
